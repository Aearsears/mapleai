#About
A learning project exploring convoluted neural networks to identify players and mobs in the 2D MMORPG Maplestory.  THE INTENT OF THIS PROJECT IS PURELY EDUCATIONAL IN NATURE AND IN NO WAY DO I SEEK TO HARM MAPLESTORY.
#Method
I trained with the help of the TF2 object API tutorial the SSD with resnet 50 backbone to recognize monster and players from a game screenshot.
#Limitations
The model will think that background objects are monsters.
